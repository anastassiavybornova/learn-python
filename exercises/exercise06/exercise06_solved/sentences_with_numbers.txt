When floods swept Europe in July 2021, killing more than 200 people in Germany, Belgium and neighbouring countries, it was a disaster that came as the climate crisis was moving to the top of Europe’s political agenda
But in 2021, measurable progress towards the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 began to be made
As a result of the pandemic, the EU agreed to channel 37% of its economic recovery funds to the energy transition, while in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the energy crisis it unleashed, European countries stepped up their investments in renewables and energy efficiency as they strived to wean themselves off Russian gas
In 2022, renewables overtook gas to become the leading source of electricity generation in the EU, with solar power leaping by a record 24%
The German public is fretting over the phaseout of gas boilers, while the car industry has successfully squeezed in a loophole for synthetic fuels to lengthen the lifespan of conventional combustion engines, which are meant to be phased out across the EU by 2035
As EU countries such as Spain, Slovakia and Poland prepare for elections later this year, and with European parliament elections in 2024, there is a real risk that rightwing, populist parties will latch on to the “greenlash” and surge back in the polls
