Anastassia's obsession: my initial motivation to learn Python was to build a program that would play Mastermind with me. What is yours?

# Want to learn Python? Great idea!

Welcome to this self-paced Python course! It is based on the autumn 2023 course [Introduction to Data Science and Programming](https://github.com/mszell/introdatasci) which we held at ITU together with Michael Szell. If you're here, chances are high that you want to learn Python. That's a great idea! Let's get started right away.

## How to download all the material to your local machine

Click on the "Code" button in the upper right corner of this page, and then select "Download ZIP". (Or, if you're familiar with Git, just `git clone` this repository.)

## Course structure

The Python course consists of 10 units. Each unit has a lecture (see folder `lectures`) and an exercise (see folder `exercises`). To complete a unit, 
1. first look through the lecture (slides/notebooks and video recording), and 
2. then try to solve the corresponding exercise yourself. 

## How to go through the lectures

You can skip lecture 01, as it mainly contains organizational material for the ITU course -- go straight to exercise 01. From lecture 02 onwards, each lecture has a Jupyter notebook; some lectures also have additional material (slides, data, Python scripts). 

The lecture notebooks are self-explanatory and self-contained. In addition, video recordings for each of the lectures are available via Dropbox share upon request. Please [send me an email](mailto:anvy@itu.dk) to get the link.

## How to go through the exercises

Exercise 01 is all about installing the necessary software for this course. **Optionally**, we also recommend that you install [Visual Studo Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) editor. 

From exercise 02 onwards, you will find 2 versions of each exercise notebook: `exerciseXX` and `exerciseXX_solved`. Start with `exerciseXX`, and give yourself a couple of hours (and plenty of tries!) to solve the exercises on your own, before you check out the `exerciseXX_solved` notebook.

## How to go through the assignments

If you want to test yourself, or to practice more, you can also do the assignments (see the folder `assignments`). They contain tasks that are a bit more complicated than those in the exercises, and require a bit longer time to solve. In order to solve the assignments, you first need to go through a certain amount of units:

* Assignment 01: doable after units 01-04
* Assignment 02: doable after units 01-06
* Assignment 03: doable after units 01-08
* Assignment 04: doable after units 01-10

## How to go through the books

In the folder `books`, you will find the PDF versions of 2 books: "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, and "Python Projects For Beginners" by Connor Milliken. Both books are great to look up _any_ of the topics from this Python course. If you are struggling with a topic or want a more in-depth explanation, make sure to check it out in both books!

## Course contents - what you will learn

After completing the course, you will be familiar and comfortable with the following topics:
* Working with Jupyter notebook
* Python objects (the "building blocks" of Python)
* Fundamental data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, further data types and how to work with them: `list`, `set`, `dict`, `tuple`
* Operators (mathematical, assignment, comparison)
* Boolean logic and operations
* Conditional statements (if/else/elif)
* Loops: `for` and `while`
* Writing your own functions 
* Running Python scripts from the command line interface (CLI)
* Creating interactive Python scripts with user input
* Reading in and processing data in different file formats
* Importing, using, and creating Python modules
* Installing, importing, and using Python packages and libraries 
* Data wrangling with `pandas`
* Package management from the command line with `conda`
* Measuring the runtime of your code
* Sending HTTP requests with `requests` and webscraping with `beautifulsoup4`

## What's next?

Done with the 10 units? 
* Take a look at the recap (see `recap` folder)
* Check out the full [Introduction to Data Science and Programming](https://github.com/mszell/introdatasci) course, starting from Unit 11.
* Happy coding!
